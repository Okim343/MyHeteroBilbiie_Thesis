\section{Related Literature}
\label{sec:literature}



I first start this review of the literature by addressing \textcite{bilbiie2012endogenous} (henceforth BGM), since it represents the core framework behind the model developed in this thesis. 
BGM expand on a classic RBC model\footnote{See \textcite{king1999resuscitating}} by introducing monopolistic competition and endogenous firm entry for both a CES preferences and a translog preferences framework. 
Firms incur a one-time sunk entry cost to enter and then start producing after one period with constant returns (time-to-build). 
This one-time sunk entry cost is interpreted in the model as an "investment" paid in effective labor units to create a new firm/variety. Consequently, the economy has two sectors. 
A production sector where incumbent firms produce output using labor and (as an additional exercise) physical capital, and an "entry" or variety-expanding sector, where labor can be used to create new firms/varieties. 

An important aspect of the BGM framework is that each variety is interpreted as a new product line, instead of a new firm in itself. 
Therefore, whenever any reference to the number of varieties is made, it does not necessarily translate to the actual number of firms in the economy. 
The stock of varieties is a state variable that evolves with entry and exit, although in the baseline, the main driver of change is entry, 
since exit happens through a fixed probability "death shock" that affects all firms equally. Because of the sunk costs, entry is forward-looking,
that is, prospective entrants base their entry decisions on the expected present value of profits, which in this framework represents the "stock-market price" of a new firm. 

Aggregate conditions drive entry in the BGM model. In an economic expansion, higher demand and profits raise the value of starting a firm, which naturally induces more entry. 
However, due to the entry cost and, in particular, the time-to-build aspect, new firms enter sluggishly. This slow adjustment in the number of producers creates a novel 
propagation mechanism for shocks. A positive permanent productivity shock, for example, boosts output and profits immediately. However, it also sets off a gradual increase in firm entry, 
which persists even after the initial shock, given that the larger cohort of new firms continues to produce additional output, prolonging the boom. In essence, the increase in 
product variety acts like capital stock in the classic RBC model, building up slowly and sustaining production, enhancing persistence.

Another important feature is that an increase in firm entry (product variety) can affect profits at the firm level and even markups in their translog specification. 
BGM show that their framework produces procyclical profits and a procyclical number of firms, consistent with empirical evidence of net firm creation rising in booms. 
The pricing of a new firm, on the other hand, influences household savings decisions and labor allocation across sectors. If this price rises, households channel more 
labor into firm creation, increasing future variety at the cost of current output. This trade-off is similar to the one found between capital and labor in the classic 
RBC framework that BGM expand upon.

BGM find that introducing endogenous entry significantly improves the RBC model's ability to propagate shocks. The authors argue that this is due to the internal 
persistence mechanism generated by the slow build-up of new firms following a shock that the exogenous entry model lacks. Quantitatively, the model reproduces key 
second moments of macro data at least as well as the standard RBC model without the introduction of capital, and even better than it once capital is introduced. 
In particular, after the introduction of capital, the model can match the observed variance and autocorrelation of GDP seen in the data. The authors, therefore, 
conclude that abstracting away from firm entry/exit dynamics can miss important sources of persistence in business cycles. Their work laid a foundation for many 
subsequent DSGE models with entry, including applications to monetary policy\footnote{See \textcite{bilbiie2007monetary,bergin2008extensive,etro2015new}} and 
open economy/trade contexts\footnote{See \textcite{epifani2011trade,bergin2015international}}

\textcite{sedlavcek2017growth} introduce the other core framework from which I derive the firm heterogeneity and matching friction mechanisms used in this thesis. 
Sedl√°ƒçek and Sterk focus on how the composition of new firm cohorts varies over the business cycle and how this affects aggregate employment dynamics. 
Empirically, the authors document rich evidence using U.S. Business Dynamics Statistics for 1979-2013, finding that employment created by startup cohorts is highly
volatile and procyclical, and these cohort differences persist for many years. Additionally, they find that total employment differences across cohorts are mostly
driven by average firm size rather than by the number of startups. In other words, the authors argue that cohorts born in booms tend to contain firms that grow
larger, whereas recession-born cohorts remain smaller on average. In particular, they show that firms born during the Great Recession were not only fewer in 
number but also exhibited weaker growth potential, which in turn creates a long-lasting drag on aggregate employment at that cohort age. Sedl√°ƒçek and Sterk 
attribute this to selection effects (which types of businesses choose to enter in booms versus in recessions) and heterogeneous growth profiles across startups.

To explain these facts, Sedl√°ƒçek and Sterk develop a DSGE firm dynamics model with heterogeneous startups and entry uncertainty. Firm heterogeneity in the model arises
from differences in each startup's growth potential, modeled via the demand side. That is, new firms can choose to produce either in a low-scalability/"niche" 
environment or in a high-scalability/"mass market" environment, which is captured by the heterogeneous returns-to-scale parameters found in each environment. 
This choice at birth essentially represents a type-draw and it determines the firm's growth trajectory. After birth, firms can choose to expand their customer 
base over time by spending on marketing, subject to diminishing returns. Crucially, highly scalable startups have the incentive to invest aggressively in demand
expansion, since there are larger returns-to-scale to begin with, whereas niche firms cannot profitably scale up as much. 
The model also features an equilibrium entry condition to equalize profits (and thus entry) among different types and a friction resembling congestion in entry,
where the stock of ideas is limited and firms have to compete for entry, especially for highly scalable types.

The key mechanism driving the firm composition dynamics in the Sedl√°ƒçek-Sterk framework is the aggregate conditions at the time of entry. 
A favorable aggregate state disproportionally benefits mass-market firms, which rely primarily on expansion. 
Their model allows for a multitude of aggregate shock types, including preference shocks, productivity shocks, and a composition shock that shifts the distribution of business opportunities. 
They model periods of recession through a composition shock that decreases the stock of high-scalability ideas and increases the stock of 
low-scalability ideas, effectively mimicking the fact that good business opportunities are harder to come by during recessions. As a result, 
booms tend to induce a greater fraction of high-growth potential startups, whereas recessions see a higher share of niche, low-growth firms. 

This endogenous composition effect means that entry in booms is not only higher in quantity but also in quality, which translates to the 
fact that cohorts born during booms end up becoming much larger contributors to employment over time. Thus, initial conditions at birth 
have persistent effects on the path of aggregate employment/labor. In fact, their estimated model shows that most of the variation in 
cohort employment is driven by startup composition at entry, rather than post-entry shocks or decisions. Importantly, this mechanism 
operates gradually, such that the short-run impact of a boom's extra entrants is small, but those high-potential firms scale up and 
produce a long and slow-moving expansion in employment as they age. Conversely, a recession that hinders the potential of the entrant 
firms filtering out high-potential startups will lead to a persistent shortfall in employment and output, as that generation of firms will lack high-scalability startups.

Sedl√°ƒçek and Sterk‚Äôs model, when estimated on U.S. data, can explain several observations that are not fully addressed by other DSGE models. 
The model reproduces the fact that employment fluctuations of startups are strongly procyclical and persistent, which the authors 
attribute to the composition effect described above. Their counterfactual analysis indicates that aggregate conditions at birth 
account for the majority of the employment variation across cohorts, consistent with the idea that it is the initial selection of 
firms at birth that matters the most in long-run cohort outcomes. In the aggregate, shocks to startup composition can create large, 
low-frequency movements in employment, thus establishing a novel propagation mechanism for business cycles: cohort effects. 
Even after the shocks dissipate, the cohorts formed under its influence continue to shape growth, a phenomenon that, according to the 
authors, can help explain the slow recovery from the 2008-09 recession. Ultimately, the Sedl√°ƒçek-Sterk framework builds a bridge 
between business cycle research and the entrepreneurship literature, emphasizing that heterogeneity in startup quality is 
macro-relevant through theory and empirical work.

Moving on to the broader literature relevant to the topics discussed in this thesis, I start by discussing foundational work on 
incorporating endogenous firm dynamics in DSGE and RBC frameworks, and then progressively move on to more recent work. 
A first seminal contribution is given by \textcite{ghironi2007trade}, which embeds a heterogeneous-firm trade model into
a two-country dynamic GE setting. The authors show how the number of producers and product variety become state variables
affecting consumption and investment, establishing a baseline for incorporating firm entry in DSGE models. 
Subsequent research by \textcite{jaimovich2008firm} shows that net business formation is strongly procyclical 
and can itself propagate shocks. The authors present a DSGE model where an expansion induces a surge in firm entry, 
which increases competition and drives markups countercyclically lower. This mechanism causes aggregate productivity to 
rise in booms, amplifying output fluctuations. Their findings underscore an important propagation channel 
that is similarly found in the model presented in this thesis.

However, \textcite{bilbiie2012endogenous} probably represents the most influential foundational work in this vein of the literature, 
also starting a line of work that modifies their model to study optimal monetary policy with endogenous firm entry, weighing the benefits 
of variety creation against costs like entry investment and potentially inefficient boom-burst cycles of firm creation (e.g. \textcite{bilbiie2014optimal, lewis2012firm})
Another influential line of work opted for idiosyncratic firm productivity shocks alongside entry as their driver of firm heterogeneity within a DSGE structure. 
An important example is \textcite{clementi2016entry}, who build a quantitative RBC model with endogenous entry and exit, where entrants draw idiosyncratic 
productivity signals, invest, and may exit if unprofitable. A key result presented by the authors that aligns with existing literature is that introducing 
firm heterogeneity greatly increases internal propagation of aggregate shocks in the long run. Notably, earlier work by \textcite{samaniego2008entry} had 
only found modest business-cycle effects of entry in a simpler setting with homogeneous firms. In short, these foundational studies established that 
endogenous firm entry and exit dynamics, coupled with firm heterogeneity, is a potent mechanism for shock propagation. It increases volatility, 
generates endogenous persistence, and introduces new welfare considerations via product variety.

A key extension in recent years is to model heterogeneity in firms' technologies or scale, often endogenously chosen, and study how this 
affects aggregate fluctuations. Excluding \textcite{sedlavcek2017growth}, another interesting contribution to this modeling approach is given 
by \textcite{smirnyagin2023returns}. The author allows entrepreneurs to choose the returns-to-scale of their project upon entry. The resulting 
finding echoes the results in the Sedl√°ƒçek-Sterk framework, where high-returns-to-scale firms are less likely to be started in economic downturns.
The explanation for this phenomenon, however, now comes from firm financing, with the author arguing that large-scale projects require more 
upfront investment or financing, so when profits or credit conditions are weak, entrepreneurs defer their ambitious ideas and only smaller-scale 
firms launch. The author also states that the absence of high-growth firms can hinder recovery in recessions, further corroborating the role of 
firm heterogeneity in amplifying the propagation of shocks.

Another branch of the literature incorporates endogenous innovation, R\&D, and creative destruction into business-cycle models as both a source of firm heterogeneity and a 
new channel for technology shock propagation. Traditional RBC models take total factor productivity (TFP) as an exogenous process, but newer models allow TFP to evolve via 
the firm sector's innovation decision and diffusion of new technologies. This effectively brings Schumpeterian dynamics of innovation into the DSGE framework, enriching the 
set of propagation mechanisms.  A prominent example is the work by \textcite{comin2006medium}, and more recently \textcite{anzoategui2019endogenous}. Anzoategui et al. 
develop a medium-scale DSGE model where firms can spend on R\&D to improve the frontier technology and also incur costs to adopt existing innovations, and apply it to the 2008-09 recession. 
The authors find that the persistent productivity slowdown after the recession can, at large, be explained as an endogenous response to the drop in demand. In the model, the collapse in output 
and investment from the crisis led firms to cut R\&D and delay adoption of new technologies, causing TFP growth to falter.

On a similar note, other researchers have introduced idea production and knowledge spillovers into DSGE models. For instance,
some DSGE models feature an "innovation sector" producing new blueprints or product lines, similarly to \textcite{bilbiie2012endogenous},
but incumbent firms now decide whether to adopt new teechnologies, effectively separating variety creation from the firm dynamics.
\textcite{kung2015innovation} tie stock market valuations to R\&D-driven growth in a production economy, producing Schumpeterian dynamics: 
positive innovation shocks can cause burts of creative destruction that temporarily depresses output but raises growth later. That happens 
since a wave of new firm entry and old firm exit is unleashed by the innovation shock, leading to a reallocation of resources to a more 
optimal distribution. Conversely, and similarly to \textcite{sedlavcek2017growth}, adverse shocks can have prolonged recessionary effects
as the economy's idea pipeline dries up and less high-growth firms enter.


The frictions involved in creating new firms also play a fundamental role in dictating firm composition in an economy. There are many plausible 
sources of frictions worth considering. For instance, in the Sedl√°ƒçek-Sterk framework, a matching function dictates if entrants will find a matching
business idea, capturing how easily a would-be founder finds a business partner, investor or idea. \textcite{vardishvili2023entry} on the other hand,
study entrepreneurs' option to delay entry, causing a "wait-and-see" friction. The author argues that if entrepreneurs can pause plans until aggreagate
conditions improve, recessions will not only feature fewer entries, but also many delayed projects, leading to a surge of entry at the subsequent recovery.

Finally, there are welfare and policy implications to consider. In models like BGM, there is a variety externality issue, where individual firms do not internalize
that their entry adds consumer surplus by increasing variety. This might lead to under-entry in equilibrium, suggesting a possible socially inefficient equilibrium 
and arole for subsidies to startup formation. However, other potential distortions such as markups, fixed costs and financial frictioins might complicate the picture, 
not making it certain that more entry entry is always welfare-adding. Recent research by \textcite{bilbiie2019monopoly} tackles this issue by deriving optimal monetary
and fiscal policy in these settings, finding that the planner typically wants to encourage firm entry, especially during downturns, to offset the tendency of recessions
to reduce variety and future supply.

The integration of firm heterogeneity and endogenous entry into macroeconomics has opened up many questions. The fundamental debate with which I occupy myself
in this thesis is: How important is firm heterogeneity for macroeconomic fluctuations? Although \textcite{bilbiie2012endogenous} show that 
pro-cyclical startup entry amplifies business-cycle volatility, they treat all entrants as technologically identical, while \textcite{sedlavcek2017growth} 
highlight how recessions skew the composition of entrants through matching frictions but do so outside a love-of-variety RBC setting and with a different question of
firm employment in mind. By embedding Sedl√°ƒçek‚ÄìSterk‚Äôs technology-choice and matching block inside the BGM framework, 
this thesis delivers a DSGE model in which sector-specific returns-to-scale heterogeneity, entry-stage matching frictions, and endogenous idea supply shocks jointly shape 
and enrich the classic RBC shock propagation mechanisms. The model delivers a better picture of how aggreagte shocks can affect different types of firms in the economy, and
how this heterogeneity in turn affects aggregate outcomes through rich firm dynamics not explored in the standard BGM framework.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

In this section, I briefly lay out the firm side in the baseline BGM model with no capital and CES preferences in subsection \ref{sec:model-bilbiie}, explain the Sedl√°ƒçek‚ÄìSterk
heterogeneity and matching friction mechanisms in subsection \ref{sec:model-sedlacek}, and finally, fully characterize the main model and the departures made
from the standard BGM framework in subsection \ref{sec:model-mine}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Baseline Bilbiie-Ghironi Framework (CES Preferences)}
\label{sec:model-bilbiie}

In the original BGM framework, the key elements of the firm side are fully characterized by the production/labor decision, a pricing decision, 
and an entry decision pinned down by a free entry condition in equilibrium. I do not fully explore the consumer side of the framework yet for the sake of breviety, since it is analogous to the consumer side in the main model which will be 
explained in detail later. As described before in section \ref{sec:literature}, each firm (or production line) produces a unique variety $\omega$ using labor as their single 
production factor, with the production function 
\[
    y_t(\omega) = Z_t \cdot l_t(\omega),
\]
where $Z_t$ is the exogenous aggregate productivity level and $l_t(\omega)$ is the firm's labor input. Consumers have CES preferences over a continuum
of varieties 
\[
    C_t = \left[\int_{\omega \in \Omega_t} c_t(\omega)^{\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}\,d\omega\right]^{\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}},
\]

which implies a consumption-based price index and constant markups for the firm. Solving the firm's pricing problem we arrive in the equilibrium pricing
condition of

 \[
    \rho_t(\omega) = \frac{p_t(\omega)}{P_t} =  \mu \cdot \frac{w_t}{Z_t},
 \]

with $\mu=\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}$ and marginal costs corresponding to $\frac{w_t}{Z_t}$, which are simetrical across firms/varieties.

In the entry block, firms face a sunk entry cost $f_{E,t}$, expressed in effective labor units, and once firms have sucessfully entered, they survive
with probability $(1-\delta)$, where $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a "death shock". The law of motion dictating the total number of producers is 

    \[
    N_t = (1-\delta)(N_{t-1} + N_{e,t-1}),
    \]
where $N_{e,t}$ is the measure of new entrants, which face a time-to-build lag before entering. In equilibrium, the free-entry condition equates the expected present value of a firm's
future profit stream to the sunk cost in units of the consumption good, such that entry occurs until firm value is equalized with entry cost:

\[
    v_t(w) = \frac{w_t f_{E,t}}{Z_t}.
\]

Prospective entrants compute their expected post-entry value $v_t(\omega)$ given the present discounted value of their expected stream of profits
$\{d_s(\omega)\}_{s=t+1}^\infty$: 
$$v_{t}(\omega) = E_t \sum_{s = t+1}^{\infty} \left[ \beta (1 - \delta) \right]^{s - t} \left( \frac{C_{s}}{C_{t}} \right)^{-1} d_{s}(\omega).$$

In the BGM framework, this his also represents in the value of incumbent firms after production has happened, which is relevant for the household's investment decision.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Sedl√°ƒçek‚ÄìSterk Heterogeneity Mechanism}
\label{sec:model-sedlacek}

I abstract away from almost all other relevant model aspects presented by \textcite{sedlavcek2017growth} 
in this section to focus on two key mechanisms: the technology/returns-to-scale choice and the entry-stage 
matching friction. Before entry, each prospective entrepreneur/startup chooses a technology type $i\in\{1,\dots,I\}$,
which pins down the constant-returns-to-scale parameter $\alpha_i\in(0,1)$. Once active, an incumbent of age $a$ 
produces according to 
\[
y_{i,a,t}=A_t\,n_{i,a,t}^{\alpha_i},
\]
where $A_t$ is aggregate TFP and $n_{i,a,t}$ denotes employment. The heterogeneity in $\alpha_i$ implies 
heterogeneous optimal sizes for different startups, with size refering to the size of employment $n_{i,a,t}$ . Low-$\alpha_i$ firms remain small due to smaller scalability, whereas high-$\alpha_i$ firms can scale 
to thousands of workers over their life-cycle, matching empirical cohort size distributions. 

After a business-idea/technology-type is chosen, the firms faces the entry-stage matching friction. Let $e_{i,t}$ be
the measure of aspiring entrants that select technology $i$ at time $t$, and let $\psi_{i,t}$ denote the stock 
of business opportunities of type $i$ (with $\sum_i\psi_{i,t}=\Psi$). Because multiple entrants may chase the same idea, only
a fraction does actually succed. Sucessful startups $m_{i,t}$ are generated by a Cobb-Douglas matching function

\[
m_{i,0,t}=e_{i,t}^{\phi}\psi_{i,t}^{\,1-\phi},
\]
where $\phi\in(0,1)$ is the matching elasticity, such that the sucess probability is pinned down by:

\[
P_{i,t}\;=\;\frac{m_{i,0,t}}{e_{i,t}}=e_{i,t}^{\,\phi-1}\psi_{i,t}^{\,1-\phi}.
\]

After paying the sunk entry cost $\chi$, a potential entrant earns expected value a potential entrant earns 
expected value $P_{i,t}V_{i,0,t}(0,F_t)$, where $V_{i,0,t}$ is the value of a newborn firm at time $t$ for technology type $i$.
Free entry therefore requires
\[

\]
which pins down $P_{i,t}$ (and hence $m_{i,0,t}$) endogenously. In their quantitative implementation, the authors treat the 
probability $P_{i,t}$ as a fixed parameter due to data avaliability issues with $\psi_{i,t}$, which is a strategy also adopted
the main model presented later on.

The interaction between these two mechanisms creates rich firm dynamics. Because higher-$\alpha_i$ technologies yield 
larger $V_{i,0,t}$, condition (FE) forces their $P_{i,t}$ to fall‚Äîi.e.\ they face tougher matching‚Äîso shocks that 
shift the opportunity mix $\psi_{i,t}$ endogenously tilt the composition of entrants toward or away from high-growth firms. 
This joint mechanism of technology heterogeneity and matching frictions drives the persistent 
cohort‚Äêquality effects documented before in section \ref{sec:literature}.
